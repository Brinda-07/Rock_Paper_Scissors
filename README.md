## Overview


Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand game usually played between two people. This version of the game is implemented as a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play against the computer, making their choice of rock, paper, or scissors and seeing the result of the game instantly on the screen.
## Usage/Examples
1. The game starts when the player selects their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking the corresponding button.
2. Computer Choice: After the player selects their choice, the computer randomly selects one of the three options.

Comparison: The choices are compared to determine the winner. The rules are as follows:

Rock crushes scissors (Rock wins)
Scissors cut paper (Scissors win)
Paper covers rock (Paper wins)
If both players choose the same shape, it's a tie.
